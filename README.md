# Smart-Parking-Android-App

## Introduction
The Smart Parking Android Application is developed to address the challenges faced in finding parking spaces in today's era of technological and smart city development. With the increasing population and the need to reduce chaos in the search for parking slots, this application aims to provide an optimized parking solution. By leveraging real-time occupancy data obtained through installed sensors, the application enables users to check the availability of parking slots within a specific geographical region. Users can then book a parking slot through the application, which is also integrated with a payment platform. The goal is to enhance the overall parking experience, analyze data to predict slot availability, and optimize car emissions and traffic on the roads.

## System Features
The Smart Parking Android Application offers the following features:

1. User-Friendly Platform: Provides a mobile-based platform that allows users to reserve a parking slot before arriving at their desired geographic region.
2. Real-Time Availability Map: Offers a real-time availability map of parking spaces, indicating the occupancy and availability of slots, helping users make informed decisions.
3. Affordable Smart Parking: Users are charged only for the duration their car occupies the slot, eliminating the need for hourly wages.
4. Systematic Management: Sends alerts to users before their booking duration ends, ensuring timely checkouts and efficient slot utilization.
5. Carpooling Provision: Enables users traveling to the same destination to engage in carpooling, reducing the number of cars on the road.
6. On-Spot Slot Allocation: Provides slots based on the number of vacant parking slots available for users who arrive without a booking.

## System Description
Traditionally, parking management systems have faced challenges in efficient utilization of parking spaces. To overcome these challenges, the Smart Parking Android Application leverages the concept of Smart Parking, revolutionizing the existing parking management system with the latest technological advancements. By incorporating sensors inside parking slots, real-time occupancy data is collected, allowing users to have accurate information about available parking spaces in a given area. The system ensures slot availability by booking slots for users, accommodating the dynamic nature of occupancy changes. This enhances the overall parking management mechanism and helps achieve optimized parking space utilization.

## Literature Survey
Several approaches have been proposed for intelligent parking systems aiming to enhance management capabilities and user experiences. The implementation of IoT-based solutions has gained popularity, enabling the collection of real-time occupancy information using sensors. These systems provide users with up-to-date parking occupancy details and leverage analysis modules to make informed decisions. Image processing capabilities have also been utilized to analyze slot occupancy based on captured images. These advancements highlight the importance of proper parking space utilization and administration for efficient traffic management in smart cities.

## Proposed System
The Smart Parking Android Application digitizes the parking industry by providing a mobile-based parking management system with IoT capabilities. It streamlines the entire parking process, from slot booking to occupancy auditing. The application allows users to access information about parking slot occupancy, rates, and directions to reach their booked slots. For parking area managers, the application digitizes booking management, authentication, and payment processes.

The system encompasses the following modules:

1. Slot Booking Module: Enables users to pre-book parking slots, reducing search time and ensuring slot availability. Users can view the layout of parking slots in a specific region, book desired slots for desired durations, and receive alerts before the booking period ends.
2. Live Tracking Module: Tracks users' registered vehicles from their starting location to the designated parking slot. The estimated time of arrival (ETA) is dynamically adjusted based on real-time traffic statistics.
3. Payment Module: Facilitates cashless payment transactions using the application-specific currency, "Caros." Users can also opt for monthly subscriptions and memberships.
4. Carpooling Module: Allows users to offer their cars for carpooling or join existing carpooling.
